## **Inspiration**

As students, we often feel overwhelmed by our workload, and find it hard to maintain a good school-work-life balance. We wanted to create a straightforward daily planner that arranges tasks in a few clicks.


## **What it does**

Jam-Packed is an easy-to-use daily planner. Add new tasks, classify them as blocked or moveable, 
and delete old ones. 
When you create a moveable task, the daily planner displays all the valid start times for the duration of the task. You can then select the start time that you prefer.
Donâ€™t waste time on the planning part, spend more time on the doing part! 

## **How we built it**

Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS and php were mostly used for the interface.

Backend: We used Javascript to loop through the existing tasks and return valid start times. 



## **Challenges we ran into**

The most challenging part was to assemble the different parts of the code, especially when it came to user input. We spent a lot of time looking for ways to make the different languages interact and reference the objects created in the different files.


## **What we learned**

For most of us, this was our first time coding in JavaScript and php, as well as using VSCode and Node.
From self-learning new languages and using new platforms to ultimately creating a finished product in 41 hours was definitely challenging but even more rewarding!
